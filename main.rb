  # function starts, two players are instantiated  

  # method: calls question class by first player... changes boolean to "false" to swtich to player two next round, and vise-versa w/ IF statement

  # generate two random integers between 1 and 20

  # generate sum of those two integers and set answer instance variable

  # generate question statement and input from user

  # take input and compare to ans

  # IF RIGHT: print validation and scoreboard of lives
  
  # IF WRONG: print warning and scoreboard

# IF both lives are still > 0, new turn begins using second player (could use boolean to change who's asking next)

# IF one player is == 0, print winner and their score and GAME OVER
